Please note that according to our calculations, the total monetary value of the list is higher than the 661 million EUR declared by the government. The reason for this discrepancy lies in our methodology, since we only use retail market prices and we follow an upper bound rule, which means that we assume no depreciation and we always choose the most expensive item. Due to this reason, the monetary value of the delivered items must be higher than the real monetary value of the items sent (see ""Total military aid sent""). The items are financed with the 1,2 billion EUR in in-kind military support pledged by Scholz, the German Chancellor, on April 15, 2022. On this day (see ""Source of Aid 1""),  the German Chancellor  announced the provision of 2 billion EUR in additional military aid for Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Out of the total sum, we do not consider the 400 million EUR devoted to other countries and the 400 million EUR share to the European Peace Facility (EPF), which is a contribution offered by almost every EU member. Thus, we report the total aid, namely the 1.2 billion EUR, in column ""G"". Please note that the  661.226.068 EUR are included in the 1,2 billion EUR.

Due to this reason, the monetary value of the delivered items must be higher than the real monetary value of the items sent (see ""Total military aid sent""). The items are financed with the 1,2 billion EUR in in-kind military support pledged by Scholz, the German Chancellor, on April 15, 2022. On this day (see ""Source of Aid 1""),  the German Chancellor  announced the provision of 2 billion EUR in additional military aid for Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Out of the total sum, we do not consider the 400 million EUR devoted to other countries and the 400 million EUR share to the European Peace Facility (EPF), which is a contribution offered by almost every EU member.
