DEM1,Germany,2022-04-26 00:00:00,Military,Weapons and Equipment,"According to ""Source of Aid 2"", which is the official source of the German ministry of defence, Germany has committed 1.540.932.933 EUR in military aid to Ukraine between January 1 and November 14. Although the time period of our analysis starts on January 24, we still decided to refer to this number because there is no other availabe official source. We have also listed all items sent by the ministry, which you can find in columns ""I"". The list contains items that have been delivered as well as those to be delivered. The items are financed with the Ertüchtigungshilfe pledged by Scholz, the German Chancellor, on April 15, 2022. On this day (see ""Source of Aid 1""),  the German Chancellor  announced the provision of 2 billion EUR in additional military aid for Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Out of this sum, we do not consider the 400 million EUR share to the European Peace Facility (EPF), which is a mandatory contribution offered by almost every EU member. In the 2022 fiscal budget, EUR 1.2 billion were intended for Ukraine as well as EUR 400 million for other countries, which can include Ukraine. Unfortunately, the items contain new military goods, old ones from Bundeswehr stocks as well as those who do not need licencing for export. Even though we do have the committed number of 1.540.932.933 EUR as the sum of all the licences listed, trying to estimate delivery values is too uncertain. Especially items from Bundeswehr stocks are evaluated with their time value in the official BR source with no indication on what that value is. Evaluating these items with current prices will likely lead to vast overevaluation of the delivery value, on top of uncountable or unquantifyable items further increaseing the degree of uncertainty. We therefore do not report delivery values as the degree of uncertainty regarding the prices is too high.

The items are financed with the Ertüchtigungshilfe pledged by Scholz, the German Chancellor, on April 15, 2022. On this day (see ""Source of Aid 1""),  the German Chancellor  announced the provision of 2 billion EUR in additional military aid for Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Out of this sum, we do not consider the 400 million EUR share to the European Peace Facility (EPF), which is a mandatory contribution offered by almost every EU member. In the 2022 fiscal budget, EUR 1.2 billion were intended for Ukraine as well as EUR 400 million for other countries, which can include Ukraine. Unfortunately, the items contain new military goods, old ones from Bundeswehr stocks as well as those who do not need licencing for export. Even though we do have the committed number of 1.540.932.933 EUR as the sum of all the licences listed, trying to estimate delivery values is too uncertain. Especially items from Bundeswehr stocks are evaluated with their time value in the official BR source with no indication on what that value is. Evaluating these items with current prices will likely lead to vast overevaluation of the delivery value, on top of uncountable or unquantifyable items further increaseing the degree of uncertainty. We therefore do not report delivery values as the degree of uncertainty regarding the prices is too high.

In the 2022 fiscal budget, EUR 1.2 billion were intended for Ukraine as well as EUR 400 million for other countries, which can include Ukraine. Unfortunately, the items contain new military goods, old ones from Bundeswehr stocks as well as those who do not need licencing for export. Even though we do have the committed number of 1.540.932.933 EUR as the sum of all the licences listed, trying to estimate delivery values is too uncertain. Especially items from Bundeswehr stocks are evaluated with their time value in the official BR source with no indication on what that value is. Evaluating these items with current prices will likely lead to vast overevaluation of the delivery value, on top of uncountable or unquantifyable items further increaseing the degree of uncertainty. We therefore do not report delivery values as the degree of uncertainty regarding the prices is too high.

In the 2022 fiscal budget, EUR 1.2 billion were intended for Ukraine as well as EUR 400 million for other countries, which can include Ukraine. Unfortunately, the items contain new military goods, old ones from Bundeswehr stocks as well as those who do not need licencing for export.

The items are financed with the Ertüchtigungshilfe pledged by Scholz, the German Chancellor, on April 15, 2022.

Out of this sum, we do not consider the 400 million EUR share to the European Peace Facility (EPF), which is a mandatory contribution offered by almost every EU member. In the 2022 fiscal budget, EUR 1.2 billion were intended for Ukraine as well as EUR 400 million for other countries, which can include Ukraine. Unfortunately, the items contain new military goods, old ones from Bundeswehr stocks as well as those who do not need licencing for export.

Out of this sum, we do not consider the 400 million EUR share to the European Peace Facility (EPF), which is a mandatory contribution offered by almost every EU member. In the 2022 fiscal budget, EUR 1.2 billion were intended for Ukraine as well as EUR 400 million for other countries, which can include Ukraine.

DEM1,Germany,until 11/20/2022,Military,Weapons and Equipment,"According to ""Source of Aid 2"", which is the official source of the German ministry of defence, Germany has committed 1.540.932.933 EUR in military aid to Ukraine between January 1 and November 14. Although the time period of our analysis starts on January 24, we still decided to refer to this number because there is no other availabe official source. We have also listed all items sent by the ministry, which you can find in columns ""I"". The list contains items that have been delivered as well as those to be delivered. The items are financed with the Ertüchtigungshilfe pledged by Scholz, the German Chancellor, on April 15, 2022. On this day (see ""Source of Aid 1""),  the German Chancellor  announced the provision of 2 billion EUR in additional military aid for Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Out of this sum, we do not consider the 400 million EUR share to the European Peace Facility (EPF), which is a mandatory contribution offered by almost every EU member. In the 2022 fiscal budget, EUR 1.2 billion were intended for Ukraine as well as EUR 400 million for other countries, which can include Ukraine. Unfortunately, the items contain new military goods, old ones from Bundeswehr stocks as well as those who do not need licencing for export. Even though we do have the committed number of 1.540.932.933 EUR as the sum of all the licences listed, trying to estimate delivery values is too uncertain. Especially items from Bundeswehr stocks are evaluated with their time value in the official BR source with no indication on what that value is. Evaluating these items with current prices will likely lead to vast overevaluation of the delivery value, on top of uncountable or unquantifyable items further increaseing the degree of uncertainty. We therefore do not report delivery values as the degree of uncertainty regarding the prices is too high.
